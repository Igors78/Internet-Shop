This project is the final in the Microverse HTML & CSS module - CAPSTONE. Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications. The project for the HTML & CSS Capstone Project is based on an online shop for electronics. The given design of the website should be followed, but the content personalized. Project build for 3 screen sizes, small up to 576px wide, tablet size up to 768px and bigger screen sizes more than 768px. Bootstrap used for responsive layout and JS actions.
I choosed the weapon collectables for my e-store page, as it is very popular segment of business with millions dollars in turnover and costs of items reaching thousands per separate one.The design reflects the original e-store page developed by Mohammed Awad, please see the design sketch in his profile via the link below
