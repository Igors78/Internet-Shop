This project is the final in the Microverse HTML & CSS module - CAPSTONE. It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications. The project for the HTML & CSS Capstone Project is based on an online shop for electronics. The given design of the website should be followed, but the content is personalized. Project build for 3 screen sizes, small up to 576px wide, tablet size up to 768px and bigger screen sizes more than 768px. Bootstrap is used for responsive layout and JS actions.
I chose the weapon collectibles for my e-store page, as it is a very popular segment of business with millions of dollars in turnover and costs of items reaching thousands per separate one. The page has a responsive navbar menu collapsing by changing screen size from large to smaller, SEARCH bar leads to the search results page. Page layout changes accordingly to the viewer's screen size to nicely fit the content. There are two pages available for displaying: the main page (search page) and the search results page. Switch between them by clicking the search button on the main page, and HOME anywhere on the search results page.
